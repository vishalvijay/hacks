There is a bank which deals with Money Exchange. The way the money exchange works is that, If you give the bank X Rs. coin the bank will return you 3 coins back. X/2, X/3 and X/4 respectively. All the values are rounded down. Consider that there are coins of all nominations and you can do any number of exchanges. 

Write a method that returns the maximum amount that can be made from a given coin. Please do not optimize the solution. A brute force method would be accepted! 


For example, With 36, we can get coins numbered 18, 12, 9 which sum upto 39 Rs But by further exchanging these 3 coins we can make upto 41 Re which is the desired answer.
