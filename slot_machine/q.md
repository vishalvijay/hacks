#Slot Machine
Billy is testmg an experimental slot machine that has unequal spinning wheels that shift positions at random. A wheel can have any number of stops from 1 to 9. If it has stops, then its daps are numbered from 1 to f. After every spn, every wheel will show one stop number in the slot maclunMs window, but the order of the wheels Mthe window will be random. On any spin, each stop of a wheel has the same probability of stopping at the window as every other stop on that wheel. Billy runs a series of up to 50 test spins and writes down the all the digits visible in the wIndow. 

Given the list all the test results, find the minimum possible total number of stops on all the wheels inside the machine that could have given rise to that series of results.
